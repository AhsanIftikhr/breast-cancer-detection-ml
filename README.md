# 🧠 Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning

This project implements a complete machine learning pipeline to classify breast cancer cases as **benign** or **malignant** using a popular dataset. The workflow includes data preprocessing, handling missing values (e.g., replacing 'bare nuclei'), train-test split with **stratification**, model training, and performance evaluation.
